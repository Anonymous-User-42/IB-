\textit{Let $F_{{D}_{Exp}}$ be the experimental values and $F_{{D}_{Sim}}$ be the simulation values respectively for each and every case that we are investigating.} 

\textit{If we define $F_{D_n}$ as the uncertainty in measurement in the experimental values of $F_D$, then $F_{D_n}$ is mathematically defined as $\left| F_{{D}_{Sim}} - F_{{D}_{Exp}} \right|$}

\textit{By using the above definitions we have,}

\subsection{\textit{Observation from Case 1 where $T = 20^\circ$C}}

	\textit{By using equation \ref{eq1}, we see that the experimental and simulation value for $F_{D_1}$ is 2.92805 kN and 2.92845 kN.}
        
	\textit{Therefore uncertainty in measurement for $F_{D_1}$ in this case is $\pm{\textit{0.4}}$ N.}        
        
\subsection{\textit{Observation from Case 2 where $T = 40^\circ$C}}
        
	\textit{By using equation \ref{eq1}, we see that the experimental and simulation value for $F_{D_2}$ is 2.86587 kN and 2.86564 kN.}
        
	\textit{Therefore uncertainty in measurement for $F_{D_2}$ in this case is $\pm{\textit{0.23}}$ N.}       
        
\subsection{\textit{Observation from Case 3 where $T = 60^\circ$C}}
        
	\textit{By using equation \ref{eq1}, we see that the experimental and simulation value for $F_{D_3}$ is 2.80554 kN and 2.80546 kN.}
        
	\textit{Therefore uncertainty in measurement for $F_{D_3}$ in this case is $\pm{\textit{0.08}}$ N.}
        
\subsection{\textit{Observation from Case 4 where $T = 80^\circ$C}}
        
	\textit{By using equation \ref{eq1}, we see that the experimental and simulation value for $F_{D_1}$ is 2.74613 kN and 2.74776 kN.}
        
	\textit{Therefore uncertainty in measurement for $F_{D_1}$ in this case is $\pm{\textit{1.63}}$ N.}
        
        
\subsection{\textit{Observation from Case 5 where $T = 100^\circ$C}}
        
	\textit{By using equation \ref{eq1}, we see that the experimental and simulation value for $F_{D_5}$ is 2.69634 kN and 2.69239 kN.}
        
	\textit{Therefore uncertainty in measurement for $F_{D_5}$ in this case is $\pm{\textit{3.95}}$ N.}
        

        

        




\textit{We further define, the average uncertainty in measurement across all cases that have been investigated to be,} 

    $$\overline{F_{D_n}} = \frac{\sum_{n=1}^{n}F_{D_n}}{n} = \frac{F_{D_1} + F_{D_2} + F_{D_3} + F_{D_4} + F_{D_5}}{5}$$

\textit{Therefore we have,}

    $\overline{F_{D_n}} = 1.258 N = 1.258\times 10^{-3} kN$

\textit{Upon observation, we see that the value of $\overline{F_{D_n}}$ we have found is not equal to 1, but is relatively very close, so we can say that we have some errors in calculating the \textbf{drag force versus temperature}.}
        
        \textit{\textbf{Percentage uncertainty} in measurement of \textbf{drag force versus temperature} is $\left|1-\overline{F_{D_n}}\right|\cdot{100\%} = \textbf{0.1258\%} \approx \textbf{0.13\%}$}
