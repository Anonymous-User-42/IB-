{In this investigation, I showed the effect of \textbf{temperature} change on a \textbf{sphere/spherical body} in a fluid medium in laminar flow on the \textbf{drag force} by collecting raw data related to the above parameters under specific controlled conditions to study the \textbf{laminar fluid flow on the sphere/spherical body} thoroughly.}

{I also examined the \textbf{validity} of our first hypothesis and concluded that our first hypothesis was a \textbf{partially valid statement}.}

{I also showed possible \textbf{uncertainties in drag force measurement's} with respect to \textbf{temperature}.}
