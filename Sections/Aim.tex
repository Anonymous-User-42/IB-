{To \textbf{gather experimental raw data} correlating the changes in \textbf{drag force} with the changes in \textbf{temperature} in a controlled lab setting with the \textbf{fluid flow} on a \textbf{spherical object}. Therefore, comparing it with \textbf{computer simulations} of the same and, studying its \textbf{different states} and calculating the value of the \textbf{inconsistencies} in \textbf{accuracy} of the \textbf{mathematically modelled computer simulation} to that of the \textbf{actual experiment} and vice-versa.}
