{Uncertainties \& Errors can enter our raw data and processed data in various of ways, Some of the sources of uncertainties \& errors are:}
      
      \begin{enumerate}
          \item {The unprocessed experimental data that is shared in this research report was collected by laboratory experiments, and the collected data may show slight variations}
          \item {Assumptions and specific conditions imposed on the system to model the behavior of the system}          
          \item {Owing to the unavailability of highly advanced tools and materials employed within the experiments in this study, there are uncertainties \& errors that cannot be minimized.}          
          \item {Random human errors by made by the observer, ie. parallax errors}
      \end{enumerate}
