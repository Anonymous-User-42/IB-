{There are various ways through which errors might have crept into our raw and processed data, some of the possible sources of errors are:}
      
      \begin{enumerate}
          \item {The raw experimental data presented here in the research report was collected by laboratory experiments, and the collected data may show slight variations}
          \item {Assumptions and specific conditions imposed on the system to model the behavior of the system}          
          \item {Uncertainties that cannot be minimized due to the lack of highly advanced equipment and materials used in the experiments in this study}          
          \item {Random human errors by made by the observer, ie. parallax errors}
      \end{enumerate}
