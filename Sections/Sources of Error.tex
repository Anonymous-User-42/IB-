{There are various ways through which errors might have crept into our raw and processed data, some of the possible sources of errors are:}
      
      \begin{enumerate}
          \item {Assumptions and certain conditions put forth on the the system to model its behavior}          
          \item {Uncertainties that cannot be minimized due to lack of highly sophisticated equipment and materials used in the experiments in this investigation}          
          \item {Insignificant random human errors by the observer, ie. parallax errors}
          \item {Raw experimental data presented here in the investigation report is collected through lab experimentation, and there are chances that the data collected may have slight discrepancy in it}
      \end{enumerate}
