{The following are the safety precautions that were implemented during the experiment:}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item {It was decided that the investigation experiment would not be conducted upon highly combustible materials, as this might result in combustion, caused by frictional forces acting on the fluid medium}
		\item {It was under the supervision of lab teachers and staff that the laboratory equipment was utilized}
		\item {Appropriate laboratory equipment has been used to perform and collect data}
		\item {Before beginning the experiment, all laboratory apparatus was rigorously evaluated for any faults that could result in a safety problem.}
		\item {The experiment was conducted out such that the observer was at a distance in order to reduce or eliminate the possibility of physical injury to the observer.}
