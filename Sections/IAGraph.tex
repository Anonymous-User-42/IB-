{Careful analysis reveals that the difference between the plotted readings of the \textbf{simulations} and the \textbf{experiment} for the \textbf{temperature dependence of drag force} from the \textbf{F-T} plot is so small that it is reasonable to infer that perhaps the experimentally measured readings are both accurate and precise in comparison to the literature/theoretical/simulation readings.}

{In order to model the system with accuracy, a \textbf{quadratic regression model} was utilized to model the \textbf{line of best-fit}.}
        
{The system exhibits a \textbf{logarithmic decay} with time with respect to the parameter that is being researched, as evidenced by the \textbf{numerical} and \textbf{graphical} analysis of the system. This leads to \textbf{one conclusion}, that depending on their various \textbf{inert energies}, the \textbf{parameter of the system exhibit logarithmic decay rather than linear decay}.}

{\textbf{Note}: A \textbf{quadratic regression model} has been used rather than a \textbf{logarithmic regression model} due to resource constraints, although the phase of the model we'll be examining exhibits logarithmic decay with respect to temperature and is \textbf{quite identical} with the quadratic regression model when limited to the 10 $^\circ$ C to 90 $^\circ$ C range.}
	 
{These findings \textbf{contradict} the \textbf{initial hypothesis}, which said that if the system had to model in accordance with the \textbf{inverse exponential function}, the \textbf{logarithmic phenomenon we have found wouldn't have existed}.}        
        

{It would be right to say that the \textbf{initial hypothesis} that was laid out prior, beginning the experimentation was \textbf{incorrect} and is \textbf{not} a valid statement.}
