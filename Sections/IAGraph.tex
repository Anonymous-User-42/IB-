\textit{Upon close visual observation, we see that the difference in the plotted values of that of the \textbf{simulation} and \textbf{experimental values} of the \textbf{drag force} versus \textbf{temperature} from the \textbf{F-T} graph are very \textbf{minute} to the extent that it would be right to say and consider that the experimental values are both \textbf{accurate} and \textbf{precise} in relation to that of the \textbf{literature/theoretical/simulation values}.}
        
\textit{It is evident from studying the system \textbf{numerically} and \textbf{graphically} that the system exhibits an \textbf{linear decay} with time for the parameter that is being investigated. This points out to \textbf{one conclusion}, that the \textbf{parameter of the system undergoes linear decay not exponential decay}, according to their various \textbf{inert energies}.}
	 
\textit{This \textbf{partially contradicts} the \textbf{initial hypothesis} laid out prior to beginning the investigation as if, the system had to model \textbf{similarly} to the inverse exponential, then the linear behavior that we observe would have not existed, but we see that this is not the case.}        
        

\textit{It would be right to say that the \textbf{initial hypothesis} that was laid out prior, beginning the experimentation was \textbf{partially correct} and is a \textbf{valid statement}.}
