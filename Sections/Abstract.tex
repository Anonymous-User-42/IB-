\textit{We will discuss the effects of change in the magnitude of \textbf{temperature} on the \textbf{Air Drag/Fluid Resistance} of a \textbf{spherical} body. We shall accomplish this by collecting raw data on the measurement of \textbf{drag force} with respect to \textbf{temperature} under certain controlled spaces with \textbf{defined standard initial conditions}.}
